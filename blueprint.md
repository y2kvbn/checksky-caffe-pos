## Current Implementation Plan

### Objective

To refactor the table selection feature by allowing users to select or change their table at any time during the ordering process, rather than being prompted only at checkout.

### Actionable Steps

1.  **Analyze Existing Flow**: Review the code for the checkout process, particularly in `PointOfSale.vue` and `SelectTableModal.vue`, to understand how table selection is currently triggered and handled.
2.  **Modify POS Interface**: Add a prominent button or display area in `PointOfSale.vue` that shows the currently selected table number and allows users to open the `SelectTableModal.vue` to either choose a new table or change the existing one.
3.  **Integrate Table Selection Modal**: Ensure the `SelectTableModal.vue` is triggered correctly from the new button in the POS interface.
4.  **Update State Management**: The selected table will be stored in the application's state so it can be accessed and updated throughout the ordering process.
5.  **Adjust Checkout Logic**: Remove the old logic that triggers the table selection modal during checkout. Instead, the system will now check if a table has been selected and, if not, prompt the user to select one before finalizing the order.
6.  **Update Blueprint**: The project's `blueprint.md` has been updated to reflect these new features and implementation details (This step is complete).
